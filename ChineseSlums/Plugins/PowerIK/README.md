# Readme first


I just fix some compile issues for this PowerIK plugins when migrating my project. Upload this fix is for saving time for anyone meet the same problem.

Thanks for PowerIK provide us the cheapest solution for foot IK. 

Note: Unreal engine 5 provide more elegant ControlRig for this (and need a little bit blueprint programing unfortunately).


## How to use
If you have same issue. 
Just copy this repo to your [project name]/Plugins/PowerIK

And this is only tested on the Node in AnimGraph. The control rig PowerIK node is not tested.


This project is OWNED by the original auther. (not me)
